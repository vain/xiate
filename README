xiate is a terminal emulator.

It tries to keep a balance between "features" and "simplicity". This is
achieved by using VTE as a powerful backend, while UI, configuration,
and code try to remain much more minimalistic.


Installation
------------

The following C libraries (or newer versions) are required:

    - GTK+ 3.20
    - VTE 0.50

xiate expects to be run on a POSIX-ish operating system.

You can customize the program by creating your own config.h based on
config.def.h. In any case, config.h must exist in order to build the
program.

To build the program and install it to /usr/local:

    $ make
    # make install


Running
-------

It's as simple as:

    $ xiate

This launches one terminal window. There are no tabs.

You can also run a program directly:

    $ xiate -e vim

There are some more command line arguments. Please refer to the manpage.
