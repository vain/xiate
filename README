                                 =====


xiate is a terminal emulator.

It tries to keep a balance between "features" and "simplicity". This is
achieved by using VTE as a powerful backend, while UI, configuration,
and code try to remain much more minimalistic.


Installation
------------

The following C libraries (or newer versions) are required:

    - GTK+ 3.20
    - VTE 0.44

xiate expects to be run on a POSIX-ish operating system.
To build the program and install it to /usr/local:

    $ make
    # make install


Configuration
-------------

Xiate can be configured via .Xresources, using properties named after the
urxvt ones. See the manual page for details. If you already have an
.Xresources configured for urxvt, and you are using wildcards in the
properties, xiate may work out of the box for you.

Running
-------

For various reasons, xiate is split into two components: A daemon and a
client. You first start the daemon:

    $ xiate

It connects to the current X11 display (according to $DISPLAY), but does
not create any windows yet. It also creates a UNIX socket and waits for
connections. Using a simple protocol, you can instruct xiate to actually
launch a new terminal window and/or run a program:

    $ xiatec
    $ xiatec -- vim

As you can see, though, by reading the source code, the protocol is
not very hard to understand. This means you're not forced to use this
particular client implementation. Anything that can talk to a UNIX
socket is a suitable client for xiate.
